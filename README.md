# Coding Challenge
- First, type `npm install` inside the coding challenge folder. Next, type `cd client`, then `npm install`. Now, type `cd ..` and `npm start` to run the server. The webapp and server can now be accessed at localhost:3000.
- Alternatively, go to ec2-34-207-134-167.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000.
- I took around 5-6 hours to complete this challenge.
